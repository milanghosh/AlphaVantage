About unittest
The unittest library is a built-in Python module that provides a framework for writing and running unit tests in Python. 
The unittest library provides a TestRunner class that can be used to run tests and report the results. It also provides a TestCase class that can be used to define individual test cases, and various assertion methods that can be used to check whether the expected results are obtained.
